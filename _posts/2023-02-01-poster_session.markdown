Monday morning during the Summer School, there will be a reception and graduate student poster session where you will have the opportunity to (if you want) talk about some of your past, current, or planned research or projects with other students and speakers at the summer school and get to know the other attendees better. The rest of this page describes how the poster session will work if you wish to share a bit about your research.

## Poster Format
Due to the unique A/V capabilities of the room that we have for the summer school, we will actually be able to operate the poster-session in a "hybrid" display format with the option of either a "Digital Poster" which you can display in horizontal orientation on one of several 16:9 flat panel displays located around the room (the monitors are roughly 42 inches wide and 24 inches tall, which you can see in [this picture of the room](https://25live.collegenet.com/25live/data/umd/run/image?image_id=310&caller=S25ImageDao.getUrl-pro)), or via a traditional physical poster on a posterboard sitting on an easel (either horizontal or vertical orientation). Either format is fine. There are some cool things you can do with a digital poster setup (like zooming in on parts, showing videos, etc.) that might not be possible with printed paper. For the digital posters we'll have a UMD laptop available for displaying onto each flat screen and you can bring with you a PPT file or a PDF or even pull up a browser to show a webpage. Alternatively, you can hook up your own laptop provided that it has a full sized HDMI port out (or you bring an adapter for HDMI). It is also possible that folks might have physical posters on hand already or just prefer physical copies and choose to bring them with them. If you wish to bring a physical poster let us know so that we can procure the appropriate number of poster-boards or mounting material for those who need them.

## What if I don't have current research or am not sure what to do for a poster?
While everyone will attend the event, displaying a poster during the poster session is optional. The point of the poster session is to help us learn more about each others backgrounds and interests, so if you don't have anything in mind for your research, I would encourage you to use this opportunity to put something like a slideshow together to share with the group to help folks learn a bit more about you, even if it is just an example of fun projects you have worked on earlier in your career/schooling or pictures of fun trips you have taken or your cat, etc.

## Poster Session Timing
The poster session/reception will run from around 10-11:30 am on Monday. You will not need to be at your poster the entire time since we will alternate whose posters are shown during different time intervals so that you have time to go around and meet others.
