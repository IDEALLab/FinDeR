Participants in the 2023 Summer School will have the choice of working on a variety of Engineering Design Challenge Problems that will include datasets and starter code for several relevant problems that can leverage the techniques presented at the summer school. The programming language used by the challenge problem library and many of the topical presentations and activities will be Python, though participants may use other languages as desired during the Summer School itself. Further details on how to access these resources will be made available to program participants after the application window closes, and may be updated here publicly during or after the Summer School.

## Instructions for downloading the datasets and code libraries

## Instructions for the final presentations

For Friday's final presentations, each person or group should use [this Google Slides template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TznkUSlDQxyIK-zXENdyG_R0Z7ADGJtmRknJJOQywyQ/edit#slide=id.p1) which also provides instructions on what the presentation should cover. You can update your presentation order and a public link to your presentation that we can load on the main computer using the Google Sheet link that will be emailed to participants separately.
