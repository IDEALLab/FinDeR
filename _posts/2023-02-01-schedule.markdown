The 2023 Summer School officially runs from 8:30am Monday, June 5th through 5:00 pm Friday, June 9th. For students arriving on Sunday, June 4th, there will be an optional social/networking activity in the afternoon. Below provides the anticipated schedule, though the exact ordering is potentially subject to change as we get closer to the summer school dates. While some of the topics may sound unfamiliar and potentially intimidating for those working primarily in Engineering Design areas, keep in mind that this Summer School is designed to be a first introduction, particularly for those without prior experience in these topics. The pace and scope will be adjusted accordingly.

## Sunday, June 4th -- Check-In

While not an "official" day of the Summer School, we will have an optional afternoon social and networking activity should you arrive earlier on Sunday. Specifically, you can see the [Social Events](../social_events) page for more information about times and where to go.

## Monday, June 5th -- Program Induction via ML Models
The specific schedule of this day will be announced closer to the summer school date, but will have the general format of starting with an overview of a key mathematical field in the keynote, followed a practical tutorial session in the morning to apply one technique. After lunch, we will move toward applying that technique to Engineering Design problems, and finish with a Design Plenary covering challenges in design representation. This evening we will have the graduate poster session and ice cream Social hosted by Maryland Diary.

## Beyond the Summer School

At the conclusion of the Summer School, participants can Opt-In to an alumni listserv to coordinate future explorations and follow-on papers, be informed of subsequent topics and openings for future summers, and be invited to a mini-reunion networking event at the [2023 ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conference](https://event.asme.org/IDETC-CIE) in mid-August in Boston.
