# Logistics Frequently Asked Questions

* **When should I travel in an out of the Summer School?** The 2022 Summer School officially runs from 8:30 am Monday, July 25th through 5:00 pm Friday, July 29th. There is an optional pre-week social outing on the afternoon of Sunday July 24th for those who are in town already. More details are available on the [Schedule page](../schedule). We encourage folks to check into the provided hotel sometime on Sunday. Participants should depart College Park no earlier than 5pm on Friday, July 29th

* **What are the key modes of transportation to College Park?** By Air the nearest airports are BWI and DCA, both of which have public transit options directly to College Park that take around 30-40 minutes. IAD is also in the DC metro area, though it takes longer to get to College Park via car or bus than via other airports. Those taking a train or major bus route along the Northeast Corridor can take the train to Union Station, Greenbelt, or New Carrolton, all of which have local transport to College Park that takes around 20-30 minutes.

* **How might the Summer School be affected by COVID-19?** We are planning on having the Summer School in-person at this time. This said, the health and well-being of our students and community is a top priority. We continue to monitor updated guidelines from UMD for group events and will keep applicants and participants informed if any changes occur, via this website. You can review UMD's guidance and policies [here](https://umd.edu/4Maryland).
