This page provides some information on past FinDeR Summer Schools, as well as student testimonials so that you know what to expect.

# Student Testimonials
Here are a list of past student comments or testimonials about the Summer School:

> "This was a terrific experience that introduced me to cutting-edge computational techniques for tackling engineering design problems. The Summer School was well-structured, efficiently run, and allowed the opportunity to learn from the best in the field. Would recommend this to anyone interested in employing these techniques in their work, even (and especially) those with literal background in the area."

> "The FinDeR Summer School equipped me with more advanced knowledge in machine learning topics. The pace served to go deep into the topics. The instructors were very patient with students and empowered them to try different approaches to solve challenge problems. Spending a considerable amount of time with instructors beyond the typical classroom time frame was extremely helpful for me to ask as many questions as needed and help crystalize my understanding of the topics discussed."

> "The summer school has been a wonderful week. It is great to learn all the mathematical theories and generative models, and nice to meet friends in the engineering design field around the world."

> "The summer school was an excellent experience. It gave me a great opportunity to meet fellow students and make new friends, and also offered a fresh perspective on many interesting topics useful to my research. I think that I can directly use some of the discussed concepts in my research. It was amazing that even though the level of experience varied quite a bit among the students, everyone could learn new things and take away valuable findings."

> "I had a great time. Most important takeaway for me was meeting with other students from various institutions and learning from them. I was also exposed to new techniques that previously I had no idea about. All of the speakers were inspiring and introduced valuable resources for us to turn to for our own research. Please take me again next year :-)"

> "The FinDeR Summer School experience was a blast! I really enjoyed meeting and working with other graduate students, really from all over the world, in my field of design. The speakers were top notch and made concepts understandable."
