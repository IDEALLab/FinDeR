The Summer School officially runs from 8:30am Monday, July 25th through 5:00 pm Friday, July 29th. For students arriving on Sunday, July 24th, there will be an optional social/networking activity in the afternoon. Below provides the anticipated schedule, though the exact ordering is potentially subject to change. While some of the topics may sound unfamiliar and potentially intimidating for those working primarily in Engineering Design areas, keep in mind that this Summer School is designed to be a first introduction, particularly for those without prior experience in these topics. The pace and scope will be adjusted accordingly.

## Sunday, July 24th -- Check-In

While not an "official" day of the Summer School, we will have an optional afternoon social and networking activity should you arrive earlier on Sunday. Specifically, you can see the [Social Events](./social) page for more information about times and where to go.

## Monday, July 25th -- Optimal Transport
This day will focus on introducing the concept of Optimal Transport, its use in generative models of design, and methods and code libraries for efficiently computing it.

## Wednesday, July 27th -- Optimization and Generative Models
This day will dive deeper into optimization and learning in generative models (GANs, VAEs, Normalizing Flows) building upon the first two days. It will also cover applications that deal with non-continuous representations such as graphs, trees, permutations, and other common representations in Engineering Design, and how to modify the prior material to handle these cases.

## Beyond the Summer School

At the conclusion of the Summer School, participants can Opt-In to an alumni listserv to coordinate future explorations and follow-on papers, be informed of subsequent topics and openings for future summers, and be invited to a mini-reunion networking event at the [2022 ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conference](https://event.asme.org/IDETC-CIE) in mid-August.
